# Welcome to He³ Programming language and virtual machine

He³ is a Pascal-inspired, object-oriented programming language designed for cross-platform development. The project includes a complete compiler toolchain and virtual machine implementation.

## Project Goals
- **Modern OOP**: Support for classes, inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism
- **Strong Typing**: Compile-time type checking and runtime type safety
- **Cross-Platform**: Portable bytecode that runs on multiple architectures
- **Performance**: Efficient compilation and execution
- **Simplicity**: Clean, readable syntax inspired by Pascal
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy feature addition
