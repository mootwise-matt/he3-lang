  - AST output mode (`--ast`)
  - Error reporting and diagnostics

- **Build System**
  - Makefile with modular build targets
  - C99 compliance with strict warnings
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Debug and release build modes

- **Documentation**
  - Language overview and design goals
  - Syntax reference and grammar

### Technical Details
- **Language**: C99 with modern features
- **Architecture**: Modular compiler pipeline
- **Memory Management**: Manual allocation with error checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown documentation

### Known Issues
- Minor parse warning "Expected parameter name" in enum variants (does not affect functionality)
- Virtual machine and bytecode emission not yet implemented
- Type resolution and semantic analysis not yet implemented

### Future Plans
